## What I intend to add in v 2.0

### homebrew support
* Add the opption to make your own subclass abilties
* remake use basically?

* add oath of the open sea with the homebrew system myself  
* Update all the subclasses to check for the right races  
* add a place to view / modify your own oath?
* allow people to automatically set their `paladin_subclasses` cvar to the right json so it won't take as long to load.

### plans
* make an alias that loads the right json into a cvar to pull info from for homebrew
* allow for saves with damage and effects, halving damage on a success
* Allow for checks with damage and effects, halving damage on a success
* Allow for plain damage, can be used for healing too
* Allow for plain effects
* allow for ieffects
* Still need to add support for the races but that will come when the update rolls out or after it

I am aware that currently the lay out of the aliases doesn't make much sense, and well. I will change that soon:tm: but currently I am still very busy with the first stages of production so that move will have to wait until I have a better idea of how I will structure everything in the end.
